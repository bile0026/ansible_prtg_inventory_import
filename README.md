# ansible_prtg_inventory_import
import inventory into ansible from PRTG NMS

Uses the PRTG API: https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/application_programming_interface_api_definition

You will need to create a user in PRTG with API permissions and a passhash. https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/http_api

Need to create a .ini file in the same directory as this script with your variables. Using normal username and password does not work. If you try and use hard coded variables you will have a very bad day and be chasing your tail.

.ini format:
```
[prtg]
prtg_server = myserver
prtg_user = myuser
prtg_passhash = mypasshash
prtg_tag = mytag
```

If running in AWX, use a "from project" source type when you create your inventory so you can pull from git or another location that will include your .ini file.

# To Do:
* transform all host names to uppercase so things are consistent
* possible regex for massaging host names to make sure they are in FQDN format
